 * This is a scratch file that goes along with the control structures 2 part one.
 * How to think about the for loop?
 * The keyword to start a for loop is "for"
 * The for loop takes 3 arguments.
 * One thing to remember about the for loop is that the arguments are seperated by a semi-colon not a comma.
 * The first argument of the for loop is run only the first time the for loop is encountored.
 * The second argument is the conditional that is checked to see if the for loop is run. It must be true to run.
 * The third argument is exicuted after the each pass of the for loop.
